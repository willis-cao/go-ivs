## Pokemon Database

The application includes a curated database of popular Pokemon with:
- Base stats (Attack, Defense, Stamina)
- Type information
- Evolution chains
- Max CP values

Currently includes Pokemon from the original 151, with focus on:
- Starter Pokemon and evolutions
- Popular PvP Pokemon
- Legendary Pokemon
- Eevee and its evolutions

## IV Calculation Logic

### CP Formula
```
CP = (Attack + IV_Attack) Ã— âˆš(Defense + IV_Defense) Ã— âˆš(Stamina + IV_Stamina) Ã— CP_MultiplierÂ² / 10
```

### League Limits
- **Great League**: 1500 CP
- **Ultra League**: 2500 CP
- **Master League**: No CP limit

### IV Percentage
```
IV_Percentage = (Total_IV / 45) Ã— 100
```
